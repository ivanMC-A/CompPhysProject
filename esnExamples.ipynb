    "The Mackey-Glass Equation is delayed differential equation that mimic healthy and pathological behaviors in certain biological contexts. Mackey-Glass equation can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} &= \\frac{\\beta_0 \\theta^n}{\\theta^n + P(t-\\tau)^n} - \\gamma P(t)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $P(t)$ represents the density over time of the system of study; and $\\beta_0$, $\\theta$, $n$, $\\tau$, and $\\gamma$ are parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation of is of great interests to our project due to it's chaotic behaviour as $\\tau$ is allowed to increase."
